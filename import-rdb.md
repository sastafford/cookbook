# Load Data from a Relational Database
There are many ways to load data from a relational database (RDB) into MarkLogic.   Ideally, a job is performant, provides graceful failover (possibly with a restart capability), provides real time status, and reliably executes long running jobs.  The Data Movement Software Development Kit (SDK) is a package in the Java Client API intended for manipulating large numbers of documents and/or metadata through an asynchronous interface that efficiently distributes workload across a MarkLogic cluster. This framework is best suited for long running operations and/or those that manipulate large numbers of documents.
